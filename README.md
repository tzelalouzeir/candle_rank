# candle_rank
This repository provides a Python implementation for ranking candlestick patterns using TA-Lib and referring to the Bulkowski Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts. By leveraging TA-Lib, a popular technical analysis library, and the insights from Bulkowski's extensive research, traders can gain a comprehensive understanding of the reliability and significance of various candle patterns.
# note
Some candles doesn't include _Bull or _Bear for this reason I created the same ranks with them for example in book contain DOJI as a bull but not as bear.
